## Why Every Small Business Needs a Website

In today’s digital-first world, having a website is the first step to credibility. Customers often make decisions based on what they find online, so why wouldn't you have a web presence? A good website helps build trust, engage users, and showcase your products or services. But here’s the kicker—it doesn’t have to be expensive.

### Building Customer Trust

A website serves as your business's digital storefront. You wouldn’t want a run-down physical store, right? The same goes for your website—it needs to be professional but doesn't have to be costly. Your site builds trust and signals to customers that you’re serious about your business. It's not just about fancy designs; a clean, simple website can do wonders for credibility.

## What Makes a Website "Affordable"?

Affordability isn’t just about the upfront cost—it’s about long-term value. A cheap website should be easy to maintain, scalable, and customizable without hidden fees. When choosing a solution, keep an eye out for platforms that offer flexibility and reasonable pricing.

### Domain and Hosting Costs

The first two things you'll pay for are domain registration and hosting. These can vary widely depending on the service provider, but you can find **domains for under $10 per year** if you know where to look. Similarly, **shared hosting** can cost as little as $5 per month—perfect for small businesses just starting.

### Customizable Website Builders

Gone are the days when building a website required coding knowledge. Now, services like **Subpage.io** offer drag-and-drop builders that let you create professional-looking sites without needing to write a single line of code. You can customize templates, add pages, and even optimize for SEO without technical expertise. Plus, these platforms are cost-effective.

## Key Features to Look for in Affordable Website Builders

Not all cheap website builders are created equal. Some may offer lower prices but skimp on essential features. So, what should you prioritize?

### 1. Mobile-Responsive Design

With more than half of web traffic coming from mobile devices, it's crucial to ensure your website looks good on all screen sizes. Most builders, like **Subpage.io**, include mobile-responsive design by default, so you won’t have to worry about separate mobile sites.

### 2. SEO Tools

Getting your site noticed online is half the battle. Look for a platform that includes SEO tools, like customizable meta-tags, easy URL structuring, and integration with Google Analytics.

### 3. Secure Payment Options

If you're running an eCommerce site, you’ll need a secure, reliable way to accept payments. Many website builders now include eCommerce functionality, but be sure to choose one that offers secure payment gateways and encrypts customer data.
