## Why Do Small Businesses Need a Website?

In today’s digital era, a website is a small business’s storefront online. It's where customers learn about products, check operating hours, and even make purchases. Without a website, your business could miss out on valuable connections. Websites lend credibility and provide a permanent spot for your audience to find you.

### Does a Website Boost Business?

Absolutely! According to research, **over 70% of customers** research companies online before making a purchase. A website allows you to control your brand's narrative, display customer reviews, and showcase products or services. It’s also a platform to implement SEO strategies to attract organic traffic.

## Choosing Between Custom Websites and DIY Builders

Deciding between a custom-built website and a DIY website builder often depends on budget and technical skills. Here’s how each option compares:

### Custom Websites: High Cost, High Flexibility

With a custom site, you’re hiring a developer to create a unique site tailored to your business. While this option provides flexibility, it’s generally expensive. **Custom websites** start around $2,000 and can go much higher depending on features.

### DIY Builders: Affordable and Accessible

DIY website builders like **Wix**, **Squarespace**, and **WordPress** offer templates, hosting, and easy customization for beginners. They’re ideal for small budgets, with packages as low as $10 monthly. With drag-and-drop builders, you don’t need coding skills to get a sleek, modern look.

#### Popular DIY Builders for Small Business

- **Wix**: Known for ease of use, with a wide range of templates.
- **Squarespace**: Offers beautiful, mobile-responsive designs.
- **WordPress**: Highly flexible with thousands of plugins, though it requires some learning.
- **[SubPage](https://subpage.io/)**: A new platform that focuses on simplicity and affordability for small businesses.

## Key Features Small Businesses Should Look For

When creating a website, certain features are non-negotiable. Here’s a rundown of essential website elements every small business should prioritize:

### 1. Mobile Responsiveness

With **mobile browsing surpassing desktop**, it’s vital for websites to display correctly on smartphones and tablets. Google also prioritizes mobile-friendly sites in search rankings.

### 2. SEO Capabilities

SEO helps small businesses rank higher on Google. Look for platforms that offer built-in SEO tools like **meta tags**, **sitemap generation**, and **easy navigation structure**.

### 3. User-Friendly Navigation

An intuitive, simple navigation keeps visitors on your site longer. Avoid cluttered menus and prioritize links to important pages like your **About**, **Products**, **Services**, and **Contact** pages.

## Website Design Essentials on a Budget

A visually appealing site doesn’t have to cost a fortune. Here are ways to enhance your website's look without the high cost:

### Using Templates

Most DIY builders offer templates suited for various industries. Choose a template that aligns with your brand identity and customize colors, fonts, and images to make it your own.

### Stock Images and Basic Graphics

Use free resources like **Unsplash** and **Pexels** to get high-quality images. These sites offer royalty-free images that can make your site look polished without the cost of a photographer.

#### Should You Invest in Logo Design?

A logo gives your brand a professional touch. While you can design one yourself using tools like **Canva**, investing a small amount in a professional logo can be worthwhile.

## Essential Pages Every Small Business Website Needs

Creating a website doesn’t mean adding every possible page. Focus on the basics first:

### 1. Home Page

This is often the first impression, so make it count. Include a short blurb about what your business does, key selling points, and a call to action.

### 2. About Us

Customers love to know who they’re buying from. An **About Us** page with your story, values, and mission builds trust and makes your business feel approachable.

### 3. Product or Service Page

Showcase your products or services with descriptions, high-quality images, and prices. Make it easy for customers to understand what they’re getting.

### 4. Contact Page

List ways for customers to reach you, including a contact form, email address, and phone number if possible.

## Understanding Hosting and Domains

A domain name is your website’s address (e.g., yourbusiness.com), while hosting is the service that stores your site files. Many DIY builders include hosting in their plans, but understanding the basics can save costs.

### What’s a Good Domain Name?

Keep it short, memorable, and reflective of your brand. If possible, use .com, as it's widely recognized and trusted.

## SEO Strategies to Increase Visibility

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is essential for driving traffic. Here’s how small businesses can optimize their websites:

### Keyword Research

Use tools like **Google Keyword Planner** or **Ahrefs** to find keywords related to your business. This helps you target phrases customers are searching for.

### On-Page SEO

Incorporate keywords naturally in your content, titles, and descriptions. Don’t overdo it; focus on readability and relevance.

#### External Links

Include external links to credible sources for added authority. For example, you can link to Wikipedia or reliable industry sites to support your claims.

## The Cost Breakdown of a Small Business Website

Budgeting is crucial. Let’s explore typical costs associated with a small business website:

### Domain Name Costs

Domains usually cost around $10-15 annually, depending on the provider. Some builders include a free domain in their plans for the first year.

### Hosting

Hosting costs vary. If using WordPress, expect $5-10 monthly for budget-friendly hosting services like **Bluehost** or **SiteGround**.

### Design and Development

For a DIY website, templates and images are often included. With custom sites, you’ll spend more for design and coding work.

## Keeping Your Website Secure

Security is critical, especially for e-commerce sites handling customer data. Basic steps include:

### SSL Certificates

An SSL certificate encrypts data between your site and users, improving security. Google also ranks sites with SSL certificates higher.

### Regular Updates

If you’re using **WordPress**, ensure your plugins and themes are updated. This helps prevent security breaches.

## How to Promote Your Website Without a Huge Budget

Launching the site is only the beginning. Promoting it on a small budget is key. Here’s how:

### Social Media Marketing

Platforms like **Facebook** and **Instagram** are invaluable for reaching customers. Set up a business page and post regularly.

### Google My Business

For local businesses, a **Google My Business** listing improves visibility on local searches and maps.
